My ideas for todo-list:

Features:
    *You can input a string
    *String is displayed as a "ToDo"
    *The ToDo can be deleted/greyed out
    *OPTIONAL: Calendar-view, you can push a button, see a calendar and select "active" day
    *OPTIONAL: You can make separate Todo-lists for every day of the Month

Either:
A mobile-first, single page, web application.
    This will probably require some back-end and AJAX though. It will make the
    optional features easier/possible.
    So maybe not as our first project?

Or:
Single page web site.
    Using just HTML,CSS, and plain JavaScript make a site. This will probably
    make the optional features impossible/hard.
