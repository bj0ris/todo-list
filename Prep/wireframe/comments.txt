Hey! Made a wireframe protoype for the project. If you want to edit it you can do so using this link:

First of. As I mentioned to you in an eralier mail, in my ideal world it would be like the app ColorNote but on the web. So of course I've been heavily inspired by that app. My take is we develop this as a mobile-first web app. It might not look good on a computer, but it looks good on mobile. If you want to we can try to make it look good on a computer too, but it'll make the css harder.



I didn't include the settings tab, because I'm not realy sure what we want there. I put the icon there for balance but if we can't come up with any settings, we should perhaps drop it all together. I have a couple ideas bellow, but not really sure about any of them.

Suggested settings:
We could perhaps add themes, but this might be difficult to pull off.
If we implement the calendar we could have a setting to show dates in European fashion (dd/mm/yy) or American (mm/dd/yy).




I also marked some parts with red numbers. Thats where I want to comment on something specific so here goes.

1 & 2: Opional. I don't think we should implement the calendar/date from the get-go, but I do think we should keep it in the back of our minds as we develop the rest.

3:Should be checked. Also not sure how we should show that a todo has been completed. We can use grey text, lined out, checkmark, or a combination of theese. 

4: This is a "preview" of how the todo will look.
I tried not to include any specific design choices in this, but here I have to. I think here we should have a live input. That is as we're typing the input text it should appear in the "preview".

5: Choose color of the note.

6: Not realy sure how the input/submit area should look. But I think it's important that it takes up a good portion of the screen so it looks good on mobile with the keyboard up.
