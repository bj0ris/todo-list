*Your Calender feature is interesting. I didn't add it in my outline, but I'm mentioning it here because I like it. It's a great feature for a user working on a deadline.*


# Project Outline


## Summary and Goals
A To Do List that helps developers build a web app from start to finish. They go through the list, select/fill in the steps they need to do as they build the app.

## App Design
A mobile-first single page app for this first version. Users can input string values for fields, basically they type in the backend language they'll use or text editor, etc for list fields. Multiple to do lists can be made for multiple projects.

To Do list fields are "locked" until user fills certain fields in a certain order.

*Bjorn: Here I hit the first snag. I think developing a web app is rarely a step-by-step process. You often have to go back and forth between stages. Like us now thinking we were done with the outline stage, but ending up going back to it.*

*And also changing one thing in one part of the project might necessitate change in other parts of the project. I think it is important to take that into account when developing this tool.*

**Saad**: *So are you saying that the list fields should be changeable instead of locked in?*

## App Flow

### Idea
User types simple project idea. This unlocks the Outline field.

### Outline
Just a simple check, unlocks sketch/wireframe.

### Sketch/Wireframe
Another simple check, unlocks Design.

### Design
Another simple check, unlocks Languages.

### Languages
This section branches into multiple fields: HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Backend.

#### HTML/CSS
User can fill in notes on basic HTML/CSS. These notes can include site structure, responsive design methods, and other important notes.

#### Javascript
User fills in notes on how this will be done such as using Vanilla JS, JQuery, etc.


#### Backend
User types in backend language to use, can also fill in notes.

##### Database
Types in database to use with backend, and notes.

---

**At least one of the above fields must be filled in to move onto the next step. If Backend is filled, Database must also be filled to move forward.**

**Saad**: *I think what you're saying here is I was too specific in the app flow and it should be generalized more because not every project is the same?*

---

### Frameworks
User fills in a framework, if applicable. Field can remain empty.

### CSS Preprocessors
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Fill in if applicable, can also remain empty.
=======
Fill in if applicable, can also remain empty.

*Bjorn: Other/new ideas:*

*As I wrote above under "App design". "Changing one thing in one part of the project might necessitate change in other parts of the project." This means that we need to have a fairly easy way to either*

*1)Make changes in other parts of the project from anywhere ("Make changes" in practice means adding new tasks or sublists) or*

*2)Use some form of messaging within the project as describen in bjorn_outline.md under Future Feature.*

**Saad**: *Even with the comments you inserted, I still think we're on the same page. The outline just needs tweaking before we both agree on it.*
