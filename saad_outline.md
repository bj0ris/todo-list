*Your Calender feature is interesting. I didn't add it in my outline, but I'm mentioning it here because I like it. It's a great feature for a user working on a deadline.*


# Project Outline


## Summary and Goals
A To Do List that helps developers build a web app from start to finish. They go through the list, select/fill in the steps they need to do as they build the app.

## App Design
A mobile-first single page app for this first version. Users can input string values for fields, basically they type in the backend language they'll use or text editor, etc for list fields. Multiple to do lists can be made for multiple projects.

To Do list fields are "locked" until user fills certain fields in a certain order.

## App Flow
