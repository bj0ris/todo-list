# App Wireframe and Structure


## Homepage
Here the user can search for an existing project, create a new project, or edit an existing one. When the user creates a project, the app-type is selected via icon. The red trash can icon indicates deleting this project will delete EVERYTHING within it.

## List Creation
This is for creating major list headings, basically these won't be formed into sublists. Red trash can indicates it will delete all sub-items. An icon can be seen for this to indicate it's importance. The green star and green text indicates that this item is complete.

## Item creation
Project title on top. The user types in the appropriate items for the category. An icon can be selected to denote what the item is for. Lock indicates an item of major importance. The RSS icon indicates something that will be viewed/edited between multiple users. 

## Sub Item/List creation
This is for items that can branch off into mini to-dos. The main item is complete and three sub-items are now available. One of the sub-items is complete and it opens up a mini-todo list within it
